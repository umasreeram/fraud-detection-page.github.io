## Motivation

Fraud risk is everywhere. One major sector affected by fraud risk is the e-commerce industry. Online payment service companies are able to collect a vast amount of data on individuals and their transactions and use modeling to distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent behaviors. In order to build our modeling skills and explore the field of fraud detection, we are applying machine learning to detect online payment frauds in a e-commerce transaction dataset from IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS) and payment service company, Vesta Corporation.

## Data & Preprocessing (Chitwan)

- Add description of data (can take a lot from Kaggle post)

### Preprocessing (Chitwan)
- Dealing with missing values
- Reducing multicollinearity
- Engineering new features

## Experiments

#### Approach 1: Regression Methods
We began our modeling with a simple logisitic regression model which would serve as our baseline as we explored more complex methods.

**Logistic Regression**
- Feature selection (Chi squared/ANOVA tests)
- Dealing with class imbalance
	- random undersampling
	- clustered undersampling
- LR results w/ random undersampling on XG_LR X_1, X_2

#### Approach 2: Tree Based Methods
Compared to logisitic regression, tree based methods are less susceptible to outliers and make fewer assumptions about the underlying structure of our data. So, in addition to logisitic regression, we tried tree based methods such as Random Forest, LGBM, and XGBoost. 

**Random Forest (Ngan)**
- Results for LGBM X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4 (@Ngan, I think RF don't require dummy data)

**LGBM (Aditi)**
- Results for LGBM X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4

**XGBoost (Wendy)**
- Results for XGBoost X_1, X_2, XG_LR X_1, X_2

### Results & Discussion 
- Discuss results of you experiments and which one we ended up selecting, final test AUC from Kaggle? (Wendy)
- Discuss how Vesta could operationalize this, things to consider from Uma's findings (Chitwan?)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/umasreeram/fraud-detection-page.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
