## Motivation

Fraud risk is everywhere. One major sector affected by fraud risk is the e-commerce industry. Online payment service companies are able to collect a vast amount of data on individuals and their transactions and use modeling to distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent behaviors. In order to build our modeling skills and explore the field of fraud detection, we are applying machine learning to detect online payment frauds in a e-commerce transaction dataset from IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS) and payment service company, Vesta Corporation.
