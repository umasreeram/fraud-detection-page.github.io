## Motivation

Fraud risk is everywhere. One major sector affected by fraud risk is the e-commerce industry. The e-commerce industry is able to collect a vast amount of data on indivudal transactions and can use that data to identify fraudsters. We are applying machine learning to detect online payment frauds in a e-commerce transaction dataset from IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS) and payment service company, Vesta Corporation.
